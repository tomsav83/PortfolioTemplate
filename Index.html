          <h2>Tom Savage</h2>
          <p>
            Having spent the majority of my career working in sales and claim
            handling roles, I returned to the UK in 2017 following a period
            travelling and working in Asia and Australia, looking for a career
            change. <br />
            <br />
            With a keen interest in all things tech, I spoke to a careers
            advisor and decided to enroll on a Computer Science course at
            Trafford College. <br />
            <br />
            After gaining a HND with Distinction in Digital Forensics and Cyber
            Security in 2019, I accepted the opportunity to further my
            qualification with an additional year of study at degree level, and
            graduated in 2020 with a First Class Honours degree in Network
            Security and Penetration Testing from Manchester Metropolitan
            University. <br /><br />
            Searching for a role in the industry was difficult due to the
            pandemic but I eventually I landed a job working in account
            management for NCC Group with the intention of progressing through
            to a technical role when there was the opportunity. Unfortunatley,
            after speaking to my manager I was told that I would have to wait
            until summer 2022 until there would be a graduate technical role.
            <br /><br />
            It was at this point that I re-evaluated my situation and reflected
            on what I enjoyed during my three years of studying. I covered
            modules in coding and really enjoyed the creative and problem
            solving nature of development and after speaking to friends in the
            industry and completing an online JS course I enrolled on 13 week
            masters full stack course to start my journey to become a developer.
